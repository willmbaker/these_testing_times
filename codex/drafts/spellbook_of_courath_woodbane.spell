# Spellbook Of Courath Woodbane
{
    Container : Spell
}
This book is bound in bark, and a living coil of vine serves as its spine and to reinforce the cover. In the right lights, particularly bright sunlight, you can almost swear that the shadows on the cover make a green face peering out at you with curiousity.
The spellbook is currently in the possession of a travelling Wizard from the Empire, an older elven man who was given the book by an old friend.
